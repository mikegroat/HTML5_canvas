<h1>Here are the things I've been playing with:</h1>
  <h2><a href="https://mikegroat.github.io/HTML5_canvas/particle_explode/">Particles!</a></h2>
<p>This generates a bunch of particles and moves them around the full screen canvas.</p>
<p></p>
  <h2><a href="https://mikegroat.github.io/HTML5_canvas/particles_connected/">Connected Particles!</a></h2>
<p>This generages a bunch of particles with connective lines and moves the particles/lines around the full screen canvas.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2><a href="https://mikegroat.github.io/HTML5_canvas/particles_bounce/">Bouncing Particles!</a></h2>
  <p>This creates a bunch of particles that bounce off one another and the borders of the screen.  This version has velocity leaders as well! </p>
